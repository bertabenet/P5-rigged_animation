This project consists of the movement of an avatar through the software PoseNet. More specifically, it is made to track the following parts of the body:
- right wrist
- left wrist
- right ankle
- left ankle

In addition to that, the head of the avatar follows a sphere that uniformly rotates 180ยบ around the initial position of the head.
